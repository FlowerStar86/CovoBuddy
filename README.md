# Day 1
An AI-powered conversational language tutor designed to help learners of all levels improve their day-to-day communication skills in a practical and engaging way. This intelligent system leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to understand user input, respond naturally, and simulate realistic conversations across a wide range of everyday scenarios, from ordering food and shopping to socializing with friends or handling travel situations. The tutor not only provides instant feedback on grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, and sentence structure but also adapts dynamically to the learner’s proficiency level, learning style, and progress over time. By tracking performance and remembering past interactions, it creates personalized learning paths and challenges, ensuring that practice sessions are both effective and motivating. Additionally, the platform encourages active participation through interactive dialogues, role-playing exercises, and scenario-based tasks, making the learning experience immersive and closely aligned with real-life communication needs. Its goal is to build confidence, fluency, and practical language skills in a way that is convenient, flexible, and accessible anytime and anywhere, empowering learners to use the language naturally in everyday life without fear or hesitation.

# Day 3
Project Description
This project is a voice-first conversational AI application where the AI automatically starts the conversation using spoken audio when the app opens. The user responds by speaking, and the AI replies using voice, creating a two-way voice interaction.

How It Works
1.	When the app starts, the AI plays a spoken greeting.
2.	The user responds using voice or text.
3.	User speech is converted to text using speech-to-text.
4.	The AI processes the input and generates a response.
5.	The response is converted to speech and played back to the user.

Current Status (Day 3)
•	Voice-based AI conversation implemented
•	AI initiates the conversation automatically
•	Basic speech-to-text and text-to-speech workflow working

Next Steps
•	Improve speech recognition accuracy
•	Add conversation memory
•	Enhance voice naturalness
